= Frequently Asked Questions about Snoop

## Is Snoop a Load Balancer?
*No*, the intention of Snoop is to provide a service registration and lookup
mechanism. If you are running multiple instances of a microservice, this should
be load balanced using any load balancer tool and it is the _load balancer's IP/hostname_
that is registered with snoop using the Snoop configuration parameters.
